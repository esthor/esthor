## 🧠 Current Focus

- **LLM-Based Agents:** Architecting, building, and optimizing autonomous agents powered by Large Language Models.
- **Developer Tooling:** Always making development easier and faster to fall into happy-pathing by using or building robust tools for everyone.
- **Evals & Evaluation Frameworks:** Once you build an agent, you realize one thing: _evals are the most important part of your entire system_.
- **Polyglot LLM Dev Life:** Modern Python (Pydantic, uv, and friends) and TypeScript

## 🚀 Current Main Projects

### [evals.ax](https://github.com/esthor/evals.ax)
*Open-source framework for agent and MCP authors to develop, run, and share evals with ease.*

- GUIs and APIs for building and running evals
- Open source, with a SaaS cloud platform
- Data-driven approach to building reliabile agents
- Enables you and your team to be confident changes you deploy are *improving* your agents overall on all the axes you care about

### [vibecheck.ax](https://vibecheck.ax)
*Free service for evaluating how optimized websites are for LLM agents.*

- Simple interface: Enter a URL, get actionable insights
- Designed to help web devs future-proof sites for AI/agent interactions
- 💡 Turns out a lot of things for accessibility for agents also translate into better web experiences for humans

---

### [allthingsweb.dev](https://allthingsweb.dev)
*Bay Area meetup community for web & AI enthusiasts.*

- Monthly meetups, events, hackathons, and conferences in San Francisco
- Building an open community for any and all web devs and AI builders for collaboration and learning
